# Memory-Card
A Browser 2D Game built using JavaScript.

The game consists of a deck of cards with pairs of images or symbols hidden on the back. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back over, and the player's task is to remember their positions for future turns.

The objective of the Memory Card Game is to successfully match all the pairs in the shortest amount of time.
